# Predicting Chess Puzzle Difficulty â€“ IEEE BigData 2024 Cup (4th Place)

This repository contains my submission to the [IEEE BigData 2024 Cup: Predicting Chess Puzzle Difficulty](https://knowledgepit.ai/predicting-chess-puzzle-difficulty/), where I placed **4th**.

The solution is based on a **learning-to-rank** approach.

## Approach

The core idea is to frame puzzle difficulty prediction as a **pairwise ranking problem**, to predict the relative difficulty between puzzle pairs rather than absolute scores.

You can find a detailed description of the approach in the following resources:
